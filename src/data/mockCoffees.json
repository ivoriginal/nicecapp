      "description": "Caranavi, located in the high mountains of the La Paz region in western Bolivia, sits at the gateway to the Amazon at an altitude of over 1550 meters. This altitude, combined with the region's fertile soil and ideal climate, creates perfect conditions for growing high-quality coffee. Roger Guzmán, a dedicated producer in Villa Rosario, meticulously cares for his farm, where he grows a mix of Caturra and Catuai varieties with precision and care.\n\nHarvesting is done entirely by hand, ensuring that only the ripest cherries are selected at their peak. Once collected, the cherries undergo a washing process, which begins with a controlled 48-hour fermentation in stainless steel tanks. This step is crucial for developing the coffee's clarity and complexity, enhancing its distinctive flavor profile. After fermentation, the beans are thoroughly washed and then dried using a mechanical dryer over a period of 110 hours. This slow and uniform drying process ensures optimal moisture levels and preserves the coffee's inherent characteristics.\n\nRoger Guzmán's meticulous approach to cultivation and processing results in a clean and vibrant cup that embodies Caranavi's unique terroir. His dedication to quality and precision highlights the exceptional flavors that this high-altitude region has to offer.",

Finca Pampojilá is rich in volcanic soil in the upper part of the Atitlán Volcano, rising above Lake Atitlán, where the south wind almost daily brings a cover of humid clouds, providing natural shade to the coffee trees in the afternoon. Pampojilá was founded and formally registered in the late 19th century. For over 150 years, the farm has been in coffee production in the beautiful mountains south of Lake Atitlán, and for many decades has been known for its high-quality coffees. In 2012, the Herrera family acquired the farm and renovated it after the floods of tropical storm Agatha.",
