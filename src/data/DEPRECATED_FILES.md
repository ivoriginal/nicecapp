# Deprecated Files

## mockData.json

This file is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

### Migration Guide

Please use the following individual mock data files instead:

- `mockCoffees.json` - For coffee-related data
- `mockCafes.json` - For cafe and roaster data
- `mockUsers.json` - For user data
- `mockEvents.json` - For events data
- `mockRecipes.json` - For recipes data
- `mockGear.json` - For gear data

### Reason for Deprecation

The monolithic mockData.json file has been split into smaller, more focused files to:

1. Improve maintainability
2. Reduce file size
3. Allow for better organization of mock data
4. Enable independent updates of different data types
